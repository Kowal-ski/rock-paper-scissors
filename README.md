# rock-paper-scissors

This is a website for a game of rock, paper, scissors versus a snarky computer. This project exemplifies all of the new javascript abilities I've acquired, including DOM manipulation, animations, and general procedural programming via functions and loops, as well as asynchronous programming via async and await methods. I have also put what all the stuff about performance optimzation to use with methods such as event throttling.
